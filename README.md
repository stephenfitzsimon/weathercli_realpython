# Weather CLI - Real Python tutorial

[Project tutorial found here](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-weather-app-cli/)

This is a practice project to build a CLI ap using `argparse` and using python to access an API.

See `weatherCLI_notes.md` for more information.

## Things I Learned
- Building a basic cli ap that parses commands from the user
	- `argparse` module
- using INI files to store credentials
- seperating and refactoring code
- accessing an API and learning API documentation

## Ideas to expand
- be able to subcommands to display forcasts
- be able to pass multiple locations
- allow for other location methods (lat/long, current location?)
- package and add to path so that it can be called without calling `python`
